# MTSAC-STEAM-Research-Proram
### In the program, I was assgined to a UCI's lab and helped my UCI ppers analyze the accuracy of measurement of a health watch, which is called MAXRFDES103.

### The PPG is an optical measurement method implemented in the watch and uses light sources at the surface of the skin on the wrist as a monitor to reflect the flow of blood.
### However, the investigation of the correctness of the PPG was important because the PPG cannot reconstruct a complete signal sometimes. As a result, it may cause loss of data sometimes.

### My job in the lab was to write a report that what capabilities do the watch have, collect data, and plot data.
