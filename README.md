# MTSAC-STEAM-Research-Proram
#### In the program, I was assigned to a UCI lab and helped my UCI peers analyze the measurement accuracy of a health watch, which is called MAXRFDES103.

#### The PPG is an optical measurement method implemented in the watch and uses light sources at the skin's surface on the wrist as a monitor to reflect the blood flow.
#### However, the investigation of the correctness of the PPG was important because the PPG cannot reconstruct a complete signal sometimes. As a result, it may cause loss of data sometimes.

#### My job in the lab was to write a report on the watch's capabilities, collect data, plot data, and combine all the work to write a final report.
#### The detail is on my research paper.
